To start the project: 
> npm start
- replace YOUR_SB_CLIENT_ID in  /public/index.html (find it here https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications)


Stripe / Square / Paypal - checkout services that most people as a customer trust with their money.
You can build this thing and put it into your e-commerce app. 

> cd paypal-checkout/
> npx create-react-app .

Clean-up process.
Google for 'paypal checkout api' -> https://developer.paypal.com/home -> log in -> 
-> create app -> 
    App name: checkout-live-training
    App type: Merchant
    Sandbox Business Account: leave default one     // you'll have the sandbox account here, you always want to go with sandbox because that way won't actually charge your cards.
-> Payments API https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payments/v2/
-> Standard payments with single page applications https://developer.paypal.com/docs/business/checkout/configure-payments/single-page-app/?mark=STANDARD%20PAYMENTS%20WITH%20#hashLinkContainer
-> COPY Javascript SDK 
    Go to /public/index.html -> add <script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_SB_CLIENT_ID"></script> -> replace YOUR_SB_CLIENT_ID
    // We are not importing any sort of party npm package because we get it done with the cdn.
-> COPY React code from documentation.
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
    const PayPalButton = paypal.Buttons.driver("react", { React, ReactDOM });

    // the example is for a class based component but we need it to transform for a functional component:
    
    - insert:
    <PayPalButton
        createOrder={(data, actions) => this.createOrder(data, actions)}
        onApprove={(data, actions) => this.onApprove(data, actions)}
    />
    
    - remove 'this.'
    - add onApprove, createOrder functions -> modify them to functional functions.

-> Error: 'paypal' is not defined 
    since we are using cdn (not installed packege) we need to add 'window.' before 'paypal'.

Add <div className='wrapper'> -> add styles in App.css.
Go to localhost -> click 'Paypal' -> 'Pay with Debit or Credit Card'.
How to charge a person a certain amount? -> change amount in 'createOrder' function.
Add console.log(data) to 'onApprove' function. -> Test the whole checkout with a fictional info.

To dynamically set a price:
    const [price, setPrice] = useState(0);
    ...value: price,...
    <input type='number' onChange={e => setPrice(e.target.value)} value={price}/>
